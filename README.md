# Esp8266-Temperature-to-Google-Sheets

Description:
The ESP8266 Weather Monitor is a versatile IoT project designed to gather weather data from a sensor, display it on a webpage, and store the data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This project utilizes the ESP8266 microcontroller, a weather sensor (such as a temperature and humidity sensor), and Wi-Fi connectivity to achieve its functionality.

Components:
ESP8266 Development Board: The ESP8266 serves as the main microcontroller, responsible for gathering sensor data, connecting to Wi-Fi, and handling data transmission to the webpage and Google Sheets.
Weather Sensor: A weather sensor, like the DHT11 or DHT22, measures temperature and humidity. It can be connected to the ESP8266 to acquire real-time weather data.
Breadboard and Jumper Wires: Used for prototyping and connecting the components together.
USB Power Supply: Provides power to the ESP8266 board during operation.
Computer or Smartphone: For accessing the webpage displaying weather data and setting up the Google Sheets integration.
Functionality:

Sensor Data Acquisition: The ESP8266 reads temperature and humidity data from the weather sensor at regular intervals.
Wi-Fi Connectivity: The ESP8266 connects to the local Wi-Fi network, enabling communication with external services and devices.
Web Server: The ESP8266 hosts a local web server, serving a simple webpage accessible through a specific IP address or domain.
Webpage Display: The webpage shows real-time weather data retrieved from the sensor, providing users with a user-friendly visual representation of the weather conditions.
Google Sheets Integration: The ESP8266 sends the gathered weather data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet using the Google Sheets API. This allows for easy data storage and retrieval in a structured format.
Timestamping: The ESP8266 includes a timestamp along with the sensor data to record when each measurement was taken.

Setup Instructions:
Connect the weather sensor to the appropriate GPIO pins on the ESP8266 development board.
Flash the necessary firmware and code to the ESP8266, which includes the web server, Wi-Fi connectivity, and data handling.
Set up a Google Developer account and enable the Google Sheets API to obtain the required credentials for data communication with Google Sheets.
Provide the ESP8266 with the necessary Google Sheets credentials to enable data transmission.
Power up the ESP8266 and ensure it successfully connects to the Wi-Fi network.
Access the webpage hosted by the ESP8266 through the assigned IP address or domain to view real-time weather data.
The ESP8266 will periodically update the webpage with fresh sensor data, and simultaneously store the data in the Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Additional Functionality:
Data Upload Scheduler: The ESP8266 will be equipped with a scheduler to trigger data uploads at specific times of the day. For example, data can be uploaded once in the morning and once in the evening.
Data Buffering: To minimize power consumption and data usage, the ESP8266 will store the weather data locally in a buffer until the scheduled upload times.
Data Upload: At the scheduled times, the ESP8266 will connect to the Google Sheets API and upload the buffered weather data to the appropriate spreadsheet.

Updated Setup Instructions:
When flashing the firmware and code to the ESP8266, ensure that the data scheduler and buffering mechanisms are correctly implemented.
Specify the scheduled times for data uploads. For instance, you might choose 8 AM and 8 PM as the upload times, but these can be adjusted as per your requirements.
Validate that the data buffering capacity is adequate to store data between scheduled uploads, preventing data loss in case of temporary connectivity issues.

Note: 
The above description outlines a general overview of the ESP8266 Weather Monitor with Web Display and Google Sheets Integration. Implementation details, such as the code for the ESP8266 and Google Sheets integration, will require specific programming, which is beyond the scope of this description. Developers can find numerous tutorials and resources online to guide them through the implementation process.
