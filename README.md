# Sending ESP8266 Data to Google Sheets

## Implementation
The ESP8266 collects temperature data twice a day and sends it to a Google Sheet, simplifying data interpretation by indicating daily highs and lows, typically at 8 am and 5 pm. Ensure to input your Google Sheet ID for data transmission.
*Note: Times are adjustable.*


## Future Plans
Considerations for future enhancements:
1.) Implementing a SQL Server
2.) Creating additional Google Sheets
3.) Displaying collected data on a website for public access
4.) Combining options 1 and 3, or 2 and 3 for added complexity.


## Code
As a non-computer science student, understanding the intricacies of the code's functionality is challenging. Extensive YouTube tutorials were consulted for implementation. There might be simpler approaches, and I welcome suggestions for improvement.
